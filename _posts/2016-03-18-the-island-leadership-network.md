# The Island Leadership Network

began in 2010 with a vision to unite the isolated leaders spread across the islands of Lake Victoria's Islands. From that time until now it has become a movement of brothers and sisters passionately pursuing the call of God for their lives and ministries, actively transforming the communities where they are placed for service. 

If ever there was a time to pray for these leaders, it would be now. The enemy is not happy that they are uniting and letting go of all kinds of offenses. Pray pray pray.
